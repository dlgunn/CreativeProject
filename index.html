						<h1>The Boy who Disappeared</h1>
						<h4 id="creation-date">Began Jan 29, 2022</h4>
						<p>
							Along time ago, there was a boy named Timmy Smith. He lived a
							completely normal life until the morning of January 31, 2022. On
							that day, when he opened his eyes to the sound of his alarm clock,
							he reached over to silence the retched alarm, but missed. Tired as
							he was, he tried again, not even looking, and missed again.
							Slightly peeved, he forced his eyes open to see where the alarm
							could be. It was in exactly the same place as it had always been.
							He reached out his arm again and only then did he realize that his
							arm was completely gone. Looking down at himself he saw that his
							chest, his legs, his entire body had just disappeared. The bed
							looked as if no one was there, and the strangenss made Timmy feel
							a little uneasy. That poor disappeared boy was me, two years ago.

						<h1>New Endings</h1>
						<h4 id="creation-date">Began Jan 29, 2022</h4>
						<p>
							It was 5th period in Mrs. Maple's class and no one was paying
							attention to anything anymore. Judy Edwards had drawn each person
							in the classroom twice. Derrick Hasam had eaten all seven of the
							eggs he brought to class each day. Even Michael Wordswerth, a
							certified teacher's pet, could barely put in the effort to look up
							at Mrs. Maple. He had a glazed expression in his eyes and his
							mouth was slightly open. Judy was 80% sure he had fallen asleep
							with his eyes open somehow.
